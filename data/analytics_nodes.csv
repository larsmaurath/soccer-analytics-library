0,Large-Scale Analysis of Soccer Matches using Spatiotemporal Tracking Data,"Alina Bialkowski, Patrick Lucey, Peter Carr, Yisong Yue, Sridha Sridharan, Iain Matthews",Paper,"Disney Research, Queensland University of Technology",14/12/2014,"Tracking Data, Playing Style",,"Although the collection of player and ball trackingdata is fast becoming the norm in professional sports, large-scalemining of such spatiotemporal data has yet to surface. In thispaper, given an entire season’s worth of player and ball trackingdata from a professional soccer league (≈400,000,000 data points),we present a method which can conduct both individual playerand team analysis. Due to the dynamic, continuous and multi-player nature of team sports like soccer, a major issue isaligning player positions over time. We present a “role-based”representation that dynamically updates each player’s relativerole at each frame and demonstrate how this captures the short-term context to enable both individual player and team analysis.We discover role directly from data by utilizing a minimumentropy data partitioning method and show how this can be usedto accurately detect and visualize formations, as well as analyzeindividual player behavior.",https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/disneyresearch/wp-content/uploads/20141211131038/Large-Scale-Analysis-of-Soccer-Matches-using-Spatiotemporal-Tracking-Data-Paper.pdf
1,A Framework for Tactical Analysis and Individual Offensive Production Assessment in Soccer Using Markov Chains,Sarah Rudd,Presentation,Independent,24/09/2011,Possession/Action Value,,What are we trying to solve? How valuable are certain game situations? How do these values vary across teams and what can we learn from that? Can we quantify how much a player contributes to creating good goal scoring opportunities?,http://nessis.org/nessis11/rudd.pdf
2,Player Vectors: Characterizing Soccer Players’ Playing Style from Match Event Streams,"Tom Decroos, Jesse Davis",Paper,KU Leuven,19/09/2019,Playing Style,,"Transfer fees for soccer players are at an all-time high. To make the most of their budget, soccer clubs need to understand the type of players they have and the type of players that are on the market. Current insights in the playing style of players are mostly based on the opinions of human soccer experts such as trainers and scouts. Unfortunately, their opinions are inherently subjective and thus prone to faults. In this paper, we characterize the playing style of a player in a more rigorous, objective and data-driven manner. We characterize the playing style of a player using a so-called ‘player vector’ that can be interpreted both by human experts and machine learning systems. We demonstrate the validity of our approach by retrieving player identities from anonymized event stream data and present a number of use cases related to scouting and monitoring player development in top European competitions.",https://tomdecroos.github.io/reports/ecml19_tomd.pdf
3,Player Chemistry: Striving for a Perfectly Balanced Soccer Team,"Lotte Bransen, Jan Van Haaren",Paper,"SciSports, KU Leuven",28/02/2020,Team Chemistry,,"Soccer scouts typically ignore the team balance and team chemistry when evaluating potential signings for their teams. Instead, they focus on the individual qualities of the players in isolation. To overcome this limitation of their recruitment process, this paper takes a first step towards objectively providing insight into the question: How well does a team of soccer players gel? We address that question in both an observational and a predictive setting. In the former setting, we observe the chemistry between players who have actually played together, which is relevant when selecting the best possible line-up for a match. In the latter setting, we predict the chemistry between players who have never played together before, which is particularly relevant to assess the fit of a potential signing with the players who are already on the team. We introduce two chemistry metrics that measure the offensive and defensive chemistry for a pair of players, respectively.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01712
4,Measuring Football Players' On-the-ball Contributions From Passes During Games,"Lotte Bransen, Jan Van Haaren",Paper,SciSports,13/09/2018,Possession/Action Value,,"Several performance metrics for quantifying the in-game performances of individual football players have been proposed in recent years. Although the majority of the on-the-ball actions during games constitutes of passes, many of the currently available metrics focus on measuring the quality of shots only. To help bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach to measure players' on-the-ball contributions from passes during games. Our proposed approach measures the expected impact of each pass on the scoreline.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02252
5,Learning the Value of Teamwork to Form Efficient Teams,"Ryan Beal, Narayan Changder, Timothy J. Norman, Sarvapali D. Ramchurn",Paper,"University of Southampton, National Institute of Technology Durgapur",28/02/2020,Team Chemistry,,"In this paper we describe a novel approach to team formationbased on the value of inter-agent interactions. Specifically, wepropose a model of teamwork that considers outcomes fromchains of interactions between agents. Based on our model,we devise a number of network metrics to capture the con-tribution of interactions between agents. This is then usedto learn the value of teamwork from historical team perfor-mance data. We apply our model to predict team performanceand validate our approach using real-world team performancedata from the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Our model is shown tobetter predict the real-world performance of teams by up to46% compared to models that ignore inter-agent interactions.",https://aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/view/6192/6048
6,Structure in football: putting formations into context,Laurie Shaw,Blogpost,Independent,28/12/2020,Playing Style,,"This chapter reviews some of the insights on formation tactics that data has revealed. In the next section I discuss the approaches that have been used to study formations in tracking data and highlight their findings. In the following section I present a case study that demonstrates how formations evolve between different game phases. In the final section, I review recent research into how teams might exploit knowledge of their opponent’s formations to exploit weaknesses.",http://eightyfivepoints.blogspot.com/2020/12/structure-in-football-putting.html
7,Do Naive xG Models underestimate Expected Goals for Top Teams?,Lars Maurath,Blogpost,Independent,21/12/2020,Expected Goals,,"I have introduced a framework to roughly quantify the varying quality of xG models. By comparing their behavior in analyzing shots from almost 300 team seasons to a hypothetical, true xG model I find that the more sophisticated Statsbomb model outperforms a simpler model. I further investigate if any of the models show a bias in analyzing shots of teams with either high or low shot volume. I find that naive xG models tend to underestimate expected goals for teams with high shot volume and overestimate xG for teams with low shot volume. I do not find this effect for the more sophisticated Statsbomb model that includes additional features like shot freeze frames, goalkeeper positioning and shot impact height.",https://www.thesignificantgame.com/portfolio/do-naive-xg-models-underestimate-expected-goals-for-top-teams/
8,Interpretable Prediction of Goals in Soccer,"Tom Decroos, Jesse Davis",Paper,KU Leuven,28/02/2020,Possession/Action Value,,"This paper analyzes VAEP, arecently proposed approach for valuing actions, and its modelfor estimating the probability of scoring in the near future. Wediscuss a number of design choices related to building thismodel and share insights on how to properly evaluate it. Fi-nally, we replace VAEP’s complicated non-interpretable gra-dient boosting tree model that uses 151 features with a simpler interpretable Generalized Additive Model (GAM) usingonly 10 features. We find that the GAM offers nearly identicalperformance to the more complicated gradient boost modelwhile being interpretable and offering insights into what char-acteristics of a game state have an effect on the probability ofscoring a goal in the near future.",https://tomdecroos.github.io/reports/interpret_vaep.pdf
9,Introducing Expected Threat (xT),Karun Singh,Blogpost,Independent,15/02/2019,Possession/Action Value,,"One simplified way of viewing buildup play is as follows: when a team has possession in a certain position, they can either shoot (and score with some probability), or move the ball to a different location via a pass or a dribble. This continues until the team either loses possession, or scores a goal. If we run with this simplified model of buildup play, what does the data look like? From each position, how often do players shoot (and how often do they score?), how often do they move the ball, and where do they move it to?",https://karun.in/blog/expected-threat.html
10,StatsBomb Release Expected Goals with Shot Impact Height,Ted Knutson,Blogpost,Statsbomb,31/07/2020,Expected Goals,,"Our hope was that explicitly including shot impact height would improve the model in some edge cases, especially those requiring particularly majestic leaps or difficult bodily contortions to connect with. While this addition doesn’t provide a huge leap forward in accuracy overall, there certainly are many shots whose values far better pass the eye test now when compared to video.",https://statsbomb.com/2020/07/statsbomb-release-expected-goals-with-shot-impact-height/
11,SoccerMap: A Deep Learning Architecture for Visually-Interpretable Analysis in Soccer,"Javier Fernández, Luke Bornn",Paper,"Polytechnic University of Catalonia, FC Barcelona, Simon Fraser University",20/10/2020,"Possession/Action Value, Tracking Data",,"We present a fully convolutional neural network architecture that is capable of estimating full probability surfaces of potential passes in soccer, derived from high-frequency spatiotemporal data. The network receives layers of low-level inputs and learns a feature hierarchy that produces predictions at different sampling levels, capturing both coarse and fine spatial details. By merging these predictions, we can produce visually-rich probability surfaces for any game situation that allows coaches to develop a fine-grained analysis of players' positioning and decision-making, an as-yet little-explored area in sports. We show the network can perform remarkably well in the estimation of pass success probability, and present how it can be adapted easily to approach two other challenging problems: the estimation of pass-selection likelihood and the prediction of the expected value of a pass. Our approach provides a novel solution for learning a full prediction surface when there is only a single-pixel correspondence between ground-truth outcomes and the predicted probability map. The flexibility of this architecture allows its adaptation to a great variety of practical problems in soccer. We also present a set of practical applications, including the evaluation of passing risk at a player level, the identification of the best potential passing options, and the differentiation of passing tendencies between teams.

12,Valuing On-the-Ball Actions in Soccer: A Critical Comparison of xT and VAEP,"Maaike Van Roy, Pieter Robberechts, Tom Decroos, Jesse Davis",Paper,KU Leuven,28/02/2020,Possession/Action Value,,"Objectively quantifying a soccer player’s contributions within a match is a challenging and crucial task in soccer analytics. Many of the currently available metrics focus on measuring the quality of shots and assists only, although these represent less than 1% of all on-the-ball actions. Most recently, several approaches were proposed to bridge this gap. By valuing how actions increase or decrease the likelihood of yielding a goal, these models are effective tools for quantifying the performances of players for all sorts of actions. However, we lack an understanding of their differences, both conceptually and in practice. Therefore, this paper critically compares two such models: expected threat (xT) and valuing actions by estimating probabilities (VAEP). Both approaches exhibit variety in their design choices, that leads to different top player rankings and major differences in how they value specific actions.",https://tomdecroos.github.io/reports/xt_vs_vaep.pdf
13,Enhancing xG models with freeze frame data,"Cem Arslan, Jesse Davis, Pieter Robberechts",Blogpost,KU Leuven,02/09/2020,Expected Goals,,This blogpost explores how to exploit the extra information available in StatsBomb’s freeze frame data to address the following question: How should you encode the position of th defenders and the goalkeeper as features in an xG model?,https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/sports/blog/enhancing-xg-models-with-freeze-frame-data
14,How data quality affects xG,"Jesse Davis, Pieter Robberechts",Blogpost,KU Leuven,01/07/2020,Expected Goals,,"In two previous blog posts, we’ve looked into how the choice of data, features and models affects xG. One remaining aspect that we ignored up to now is the effect that the choice of data provider has on xG. It is worth noting that Opta, Statsbomb, Wyscout, Metrica, InStat and all other data providers have their own data quality problems and use different event definitions. Hence, one might wonder whether a different data source would lead to different xG values and different results when analyzing games or evaluating players.",https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/sports/blog/how-data-quality-affects-xg
15,Exploring how VAEP values actions,Pieter Robberechts,Blogpost,KU Leuven,27/04/2020,Possession/Action Value,,"Starting from a historical game state, the tool allows you to alter all the attributes that VAEP uses to value an action and to explore how small changes in the game state affect the result. In the short clip below, we show how this works for the goal by Jesus against Wolverhampton in the 2018/19 season. Originally, Jesus’ shot gets a VAEP value of 0.58, but moving Jesus’ further away from the goal increases the VAEP value (because scoring becomes harder further away from the goal). Similarly, the VAEP value decreases a bit if you add one goal to the current scoreline (because scoring the opening goal is considered harder).",https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/sports/blog/exploring-how-vaep-values-actions
16,Introducing Atomic-SPADL: A New Way to Represent Event Stream Data,"Jesse Davis, Tom Decroos, Pieter Robberechts",Blogpost,KU Leuven,05/05/2020,Event Data,,"To accomodate this alternative viewpoint, we introduce Atomic-SPADL, which removes the “result” attribute from SPADL and adds a few new action and event types. In this representation, all actions are “atomic” in the sense that they are always completed successfully without interruption. Consequently, while SPADL treats a pass as one action consisting of both the initiation and receival of the pass, Atomic-SPADL sees giving and receiving a pass as two separate actions.",https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/sports/blog/introducing-atomic-spadl-a-new-way-to-represent-event-stream-data
17,How data availability affects the ability to learn good xG models,"Jesse Davis, Pieter Robberechts",Blogpost,KU Leuven,12/05/2020,Expected Goals,,"In this blog post, we showed that the amount of data needed to train an accurate xG model depends on the complexity of the learner and the number of features, with up to 5 seasons of data needed to train a complex gradient boosted trees model. Despite the style of play changing over time and varying between leagues, we did not find that using only recent data or league-specific models improves the accuracy significantly. Hence, if limited data is available, training models on less recent data or different leagues is a viable solution.",https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/sports/blog/how-data-availability-affects-the-ability-to-learn-good-xg-models
18,Illustrating the interplay between features and models in xG,"Jesse Davis, Pieter Robberechts",Blogpost,KU Leuven,14/05/2020,Expected Goals,,"We train eight logistic regression models, one for each way of encoding a shot’s location. We also augment the feature set to include a variable for the body part used in the shot, encoded as a dummy variable. We use two seasons of data from each of the top-5 European leagues and the Dutch one to train the model and report results on the 2018/2019 seasons of these leagues. As we have argued previously in several places, calibration is the key criteria for evaluating probabilistic predictions so we report the Brier score. To help place the results in context, we also include the area under the ROC curve (AUROC), even though it is a ranking metric.

19,Our thoughts on American Soccer Analysis' g+ metric,"Jesse Davis, Tom Decroos, Pieter Robberechts, Jan Van Haaren, Lotte Bransen",Blogpost,KU Leuven,15/05/2020,Possession/Action Value,,"At a high level, VAEP and g+ are extremely similar. Both methods value each game situation in a soccer match by considering how likely it is to score and concede from that particular situation. Both methods exploit the fact that an action alters the game situation and value an action by the difference between the new situation’s value and the previous one’s value. This approach rewards players for increasing their team’s chance of scoring and decreasing their team’s chance of conceding. Therefore, the differences between VAEP and g+ will arise from technical choices made when converting the data into the feature-vector format used to train the gradient boosted ensemble that estimates the scoring and conceding probabilities.",https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/sports/blog/our-thoughts-on-american-soccer-analysis'-g+-metric
20,SoccerMix: Representing Soccer Actions with Mixture Models,"Jesse Davis, Tom Decroos, Pieter Robberechts, Maike Van Roy",Blogpost,KU Leuven,02/12/2020,Playing Style,2,"Last year, we introduced our Player Vectors approach for automatically characterizing a player’s style of play. In the meantime, we haven’t been standing still and developed SoccerMix: an improved approach which takes account of the location and direction in which actions are performed. Beyond this, we have also introduced a methodology for exploring defensive style. Namely, our insight is that the objective of defending is often to prevent certain actions from occurring. Hence, some insights into a team’s defensive style can be found by measuring how a team forces its opponents to deviate from their usual playing style.",https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/sports/blog/soccermix:-representing-soccer-actions-with-mixture-models
21,Real-Time Camera Pose Estimation for Sports Fields,"Leonardo Citraro, Pablo Márquez-Neila, Stefano Savarè, Vivek Jayaram, Charles Dubout, Félix Renaut, Andrés Hasfura, Horesh Ben Shitrit, Pascal Fua",Paper,"Polytechnique Lausanne, University of Bern, Second Spectrum Inc",31/03/2020,Computer Vision,,"Given an image sequence featuring a portion of a sports field filmed by a moving and uncalibrated camera, such as the one of a smartphone, our goal is to compute automatically and in real-time the focal length and extrinsic camera parameters for each image in the sequence without using a priori knowledges of the position and orientation of the camera. To this end, we propose a novel framework that combines accurate localization and robust identification of specific keypoints in the image by using a fully-convolutional deep architecture. Our algorithm exploits both the field lines and the players’ image locations, assuming their ground plane positions to be given, to achieve accuracy and robustness that is beyond the current state of the art. We will demonstrate its effectiveness on challenging soccer, basketball, and volleyball benchmark datasets.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.14109.pdf

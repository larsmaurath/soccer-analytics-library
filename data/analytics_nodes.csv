In thispaper, given an entire season’s worth of player and ball trackingdata from a professional soccer league (≈400,000,000 data points),we present a method which can conduct both individual playerand team analysis. Due to the dynamic, continuous and multi-player nature of team sports like soccer, a major issue isaligning player positions over time. We present a “role-based”representation that dynamically updates each player’s relativerole at each frame and demonstrate how this captures the short-term context to enable both individual player and team analysis.We discover role directly from data by utilizing a minimumentropy data partitioning method and show how this can be usedto accurately detect and visualize formations, as well as analyzeindividual player behavior.",https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/disneyresearch/wp-content/uploads/20141211131038/Large-Scale-Analysis-of-Soccer-Matches-using-Spatiotemporal-Tracking-Data-Paper.pdf
1,A Framework for Tactical Analysis and Individual Offensive Production Assessment in Soccer Using Markov Chains,Sarah Rudd,Presentation,Independent,24/09/2011,Possession & Action Value,,What are we trying to solve?

2,Player Vectors: Characterizing Soccer Players’ Playing Style from Match Event Streams,"Tom Decroos, Jesse Davis",Paper,KU Leuven,19/09/2019,Playing Style,,"Transfer fees for soccer players are at an all-time high. To make the most of their budget, soccer clubs need to understand the type of players they have and the type of players that are on the market. Current insights in the playing style of players are mostly based on the opinions of human soccer experts such as trainers and scouts. Unfortunately, their opinions are inherently subjective and thus prone to faults. In this paper, we characterize the playing style of a player in a more rigorous, objective and data-driven manner. We characterize the playing style of a player using a so-called ‘player vector’ that can be interpreted both by human experts and machine learning systems. We demonstrate the validity of our approach by retrieving player identities from anonymized event stream data and present a number of use cases related to scouting and monitoring player development in top European competitions.",https://tomdecroos.github.io/reports/ecml19_tomd.pdf
3,Player Chemistry: Striving for a Perfectly Balanced Soccer Team,"Lotte Bransen, Jan Van Haaren",Paper,"SciSports, KU Leuven",28/02/2020,Team Chemistry,,"Soccer scouts typically ignore the team balance and team chemistry when evaluating potential signings for their teams. Instead, they focus on the individual qualities of the players in isolation. To overcome this limitation of their recruitment process, this paper takes a first step towards objectively providing insight into the question: How well does a team of soccer players gel? We address that question in both an observational and a predictive setting. In the former setting, we observe the chemistry between players who have actually played together, which is relevant when selecting the best possible line-up for a match. In the latter setting, we predict the chemistry between players who have never played together before, which is particularly relevant to assess the fit of a potential signing with the players who are already on the team. We introduce two chemistry metrics that measure the offensive and defensive chemistry for a pair of players, respectively.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01712

Although the majority of the on-the-ball actions during games constitutes of passes, many of the currently available metrics focus on measuring the quality of shots only. To help bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach to measure players' on-the-ball contributions from passes during games. Our proposed approach measures the expected impact of each pass on the scoreline.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02252

7,Do Naive xG Models underestimate Expected Goals for Top Teams?,Lars Maurath,Blogpost,Independent,21/12/2020,Expected Goals,,"I have introduced a framework to roughly quantify the varying quality of xG models. By comparing their behavior in analyzing shots from almost 300 team seasons to a hypothetical, true xG model I find that the more sophisticated Statsbomb model outperforms a simpler model. I further investigate if any of the models show a bias in analyzing shots of teams with either high or low shot volume. I find that naive xG models tend to underestimate expected goals for teams with high shot volume and overestimate xG for teams with low shot volume. I do not find this effect for the more sophisticated Statsbomb model that includes additional features like shot freeze frames, goalkeeper positioning and shot impact height.",https://www.thesignificantgame.com/portfolio/do-naive-xg-models-underestimate-expected-goals-for-top-teams/

9,Introducing Expected Threat (xT),Karun Singh,Blogpost,Independent,15/02/2019,Possession & Action Value,,"One simplified way of viewing buildup play is as follows: when a team has possession in a certain position, they can either shoot (and score with some probability), or move the ball to a different location via a pass or a dribble. This continues until the team either loses possession, or scores a goal. If we run with this simplified model of buildup play, what does the data look like? From each position, how often do players shoot (and how often do they score?), how often do they move the ball, and where do they move it to?",https://karun.in/blog/expected-threat.html

11,SoccerMap: A Deep Learning Architecture for Visually-Interpretable Analysis in Soccer,"Javier Fernández, Luke Bornn",Paper,"Polytechnic University of Catalonia, FC Barcelona, Simon Fraser University",20/10/2020,"Possession & Action Value, Tracking Data",,"We present a fully convolutional neural network architecture that is capable of estimating full probability surfaces of potential passes in soccer, derived from high-frequency spatiotemporal data. The network receives layers of low-level inputs and learns a feature hierarchy that produces predictions at different sampling levels, capturing both coarse and fine spatial details. By merging these predictions, we can produce visually-rich probability surfaces for any game situation that allows coaches to develop a fine-grained analysis of players' positioning and decision-making, an as-yet little-explored area in sports. We show the network can perform remarkably well in the estimation of pass success probability, and present how it can be adapted easily to approach two other challenging problems: the estimation of pass-selection likelihood and the prediction of the expected value of a pass. Our approach provides a novel solution for learning a full prediction surface when there is only a single-pixel correspondence between ground-truth outcomes and the predicted probability map. The flexibility of this architecture allows its adaptation to a great variety of practical problems in soccer. We also present a set of practical applications, including the evaluation of passing risk at a player level, the identification of the best potential passing options, and the differentiation of passing tendencies between teams.

12,Valuing On-the-Ball Actions in Soccer: A Critical Comparison of xT and VAEP,"Maaike Van Roy, Pieter Robberechts, Tom Decroos, Jesse Davis",Paper,KU Leuven,28/02/2020,Possession & Action Value,,"Objectively quantifying a soccer player’s contributions within a match is a challenging and crucial task in soccer analytics. Many of the currently available metrics focus on measuring the quality of shots and assists only, although these represent less than 1% of all on-the-ball actions. Most recently, several approaches were proposed to bridge this gap. By valuing how actions increase or decrease the likelihood of yielding a goal, these models are effective tools for quantifying the performances of players for all sorts of actions. However, we lack an understanding of their differences, both conceptually and in practice. Therefore, this paper critically compares two such models: expected threat (xT) and valuing actions by estimating probabilities (VAEP). Both approaches exhibit variety in their design choices, that leads to different top player rankings and major differences in how they value specific actions.",https://tomdecroos.github.io/reports/xt_vs_vaep.pdf

One remaining aspect that we ignored up to now is the effect that the choice of data provider has on xG. It is worth noting that Opta, Statsbomb, Wyscout, Metrica, InStat and all other data providers have their own data quality problems and use different event definitions.

15,Exploring how VAEP values actions,Pieter Robberechts,Blogpost,KU Leuven,27/04/2020,Possession & Action Value,,"Starting from a historical game state, the tool allows you to alter all the attributes that VAEP uses to value an action and to explore how small changes in the game state affect the result. In the short clip below, we show how this works for the goal by Jesus against Wolverhampton in the 2018/19 season. Originally, Jesus’ shot gets a VAEP value of 0.58, but moving Jesus’ further away from the goal increases the VAEP value (because scoring becomes harder further away from the goal). Similarly, the VAEP value decreases a bit if you add one goal to the current scoreline (because scoring the opening goal is considered harder).",https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/sports/blog/exploring-how-vaep-values-actions
16,Introducing Atomic-SPADL: A New Way to Represent Event Stream Data,"Jesse Davis, Tom Decroos, Pieter Robberechts",Blogpost,KU Leuven,05/05/2020,Data,,"To accomodate this alternative viewpoint, we introduce Atomic-SPADL, which removes the “result” attribute from SPADL and adds a few new action and event types. In this representation, all actions are “atomic” in the sense that they are always completed successfully without interruption. Consequently, while SPADL treats a pass as one action consisting of both the initiation and receival of the pass, Atomic-SPADL sees giving and receiving a pass as two separate actions.",https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/sports/blog/introducing-atomic-spadl-a-new-way-to-represent-event-stream-data

Both methods value each game situation in a soccer match by considering how likely it is to score and concede from that particular situation. Both methods exploit the fact that an action alters the game situation and value an action by the difference between the new situation’s value and the previous one’s value. This approach rewards players for increasing their team’s chance of scoring and decreasing their team’s chance of conceding. Therefore, the differences between VAEP and g+ will arise from technical choices made when converting the data into the feature-vector format used to train the gradient boosted ensemble that estimates the scoring and conceding probabilities.",https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/sports/blog/our-thoughts-on-american-soccer-analysis'-g+-metric

In the meantime, we haven’t been standing still and developed SoccerMix: an improved approach which takes account of the location and direction in which actions are performed. Beyond this, we have also introduced a methodology for exploring defensive style. Namely, our insight is that the objective of defending is often to prevent certain actions from occurring.

To this end, we propose a novel framework that combines accurate localization and robust identification of specific keypoints in the image by using a fully-convolutional deep architecture. Our algorithm exploits both the field lines and the players’ image locations, assuming their ground plane positions to be given, to achieve accuracy and robustness that is beyond the current state of the art.

Using this formulation, we propose a method to predict the probability of game outcomes and the payoffs of team actions. Building upon this, we develop algorithms to optimise team formation and in-game tactics with different objectives.

Neural nets achieve great predictive accuracy through deep learning, and are popular in sports analytics. But it is hard to interpret a neural net model and harder still to extract actionable insights from the knowledge implicit in it. Therefore, we built a simple and transparent model that mimics the output of the original deep learning model and represents the learned knowledge in an explicit interpretable way. Our mimic model is a linear model tree, which combines a collection of linear models with a regression-tree structure. The tree version of a neural network achieves high fidelity, explains itself, and produces insights for expert stakeholders such as athletes and coaches. We propose and compare several scalable model tree learning heuristics to address the computational challenge from datasets with millions of data points. ",https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04551

Our neural architecture fits con-tinuous game context signals and sequential features within a play with two stacked LSTMtowers, one for the home team and one for the away team separately. To validate the modelperformance, we illustrate both temporal and spatial projections of the learned Q-function,and conduct a calibration experiment to study the data fit under different game contexts. Ournovel soccer Goal Impact Metric (GIM) applies values from the learned Q-function, to mea-sure a player’s overall performance by the aggregate impact values of his actions over allthe games in a season. To interpret the impact values, a mimic regression tree is built to findthe game features that influence the values most. As an application of our GIM metric, weconduct a case study to rank players in the English Football League (EFL) Championship.Empirical evaluation indicates GIM is a temporally stable metric, and its correlations withstandard measures of soccer success are higher than that computed with other state-of-the-art soccer metrics.",https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343122623_Deep_soccer_analytics_learning_an_action-value_function_for_evaluating_soccer_players
39,Introducing DAVIES: A framework for Identifying Talent Across the Globe,"Mike Imburgio, Sam Goldberg",Blogpost,American Soccer Analysis,17/09/2020,"Scouting, Playing Style, Possession & Action Value",42,"DAVIES, named after MLS phenom and current Bayern Munich outside back Alphonso Davies, was inspired by its namesake’s rise to fame. We wanted to give teams around the globe the same chance as Bayern Munich to identify and sign the next iteration of Alphonso Davies, a player who could be anywhere in the world. So how did we do that? The first step was to build a dataset of players with metrics that are made available by any data provider: xG, xA, Touches, Tackles Won, Passes Attempted, Successful Dribbles, and Clearances are a few examples of the types of metric we included. The next step we took was to build a few different complex models and concatenate them into a singular model. Known as ensemble modeling, this gave the modeling team a better idea of what metrics were actually important to use. After this process was completed, we identified important metrics using data from a different source than our final model used. This allowed us to estimate our model’s accuracy using different data sources and take advantage of the amount of MLS data we had available. Just as importantly, it helped avoid statistical biases that would harm the model’s real-world performance. After this process was completed, we had our final list of 17 important variables that we wanted to include in our final model.",https://www.americansocceranalysis.com/home/2020/9/16/davies-determining-added-value-of-individual-effectiveness-including-style

As research often focusses on collective behaviour, or on static subgroups, the current study aims to analyse spatiotemporal behaviour of dynamic subgroups in relation to successful attacks. We collected position tracking data of 118 Dutch Eredivisie matches, containing 12424 attacks. Attacks were classified as successful (N = 1237) or non-successful (N = 11187) based on the potential of creating a scoring opportunity. Using unsupervised machine learning, we automatically identified dynamic formations based on position tracking data, and identified dynamic subgroups for every timeframe in a match. We then compared the subgroup centroids to assess the intra- and inter-team spatiotemporal synchronisa-tion during successful and non-successful attacks, using circular statistics. Our results indicated sub-group-level variables provided more information, and were more sensitive to disruption, in comparison to team-level variables. When comparing successful and non-successful attacks, we found decreases (p < .01) in longitudinal inter- and intra-team synchrony of interactions involving the defenders of the attacking team during successful attacks.

In contrast to the original Possession Value framework that measured the probability that a team would score from their possession, the new Possession Value (PV) framework now uses a time-based approach, measuring the probability that a team in possession will score during the next 10 seconds.

Once analyzed more than 6000 pass events, results show that, by including orientation as a feasibility measure, a robust computational model can be built, reaching more than 0.7 Top-3 accuracy. Finally, the combination of the orientation feasibility measure with the recently introduced Expected Possession Value metric is studied; promising results are obtained, thus showing that existing models can be refined by using orientation as a key feature.

Perhaps more recent examples can further convince you of this occurrence, with Barcelona’s record signings Antoinne Griezzman and Philippe Coutinho performing nowhere near the levels which warranted their purchases so far. As mentioned in Bransen and Van Haaren, despite the importance of player chemistry, this is still a largely overlooked aspect in player evaluation for recruitment purposes, along with existing performance evaluation methods being largely individual-focused (I’m not sure how much this has changed since tbh).

In thispaper, given an entire season’s worth of player and ball trackingdata from a professional soccer league (≈400,000,000 data points),we present a method which can conduct both individual playerand team analysis. Due to the dynamic, continuous and multi-player nature of team sports like soccer, a major issue isaligning player positions over time. We present a “role-based”representation that dynamically updates each player’s relativerole at each frame and demonstrate how this captures the short-term context to enable both individual player and team analysis.We discover role directly from data by utilizing a minimumentropy data partitioning method and show how this can be usedto accurately detect and visualize formations, as well as analyzeindividual player behavior.",https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/disneyresearch/wp-content/uploads/20141211131038/Large-Scale-Analysis-of-Soccer-Matches-using-Spatiotemporal-Tracking-Data-Paper.pdf
1,A Framework for Tactical Analysis and Individual Offensive Production Assessment in Soccer Using Markov Chains,Sarah Rudd,Presentation,Independent,24/09/2011,Possession & Action Value,,What are we trying to solve?

2,Player Vectors: Characterizing Soccer Players’ Playing Style from Match Event Streams,"Tom Decroos, Jesse Davis",Paper,KU Leuven,19/09/2019,Playing Style,,"Transfer fees for soccer players are at an all-time high. To make the most of their budget, soccer clubs need to understand the type of players they have and the type of players that are on the market. Current insights in the playing style of players are mostly based on the opinions of human soccer experts such as trainers and scouts. Unfortunately, their opinions are inherently subjective and thus prone to faults. In this paper, we characterize the playing style of a player in a more rigorous, objective and data-driven manner. We characterize the playing style of a player using a so-called ‘player vector’ that can be interpreted both by human experts and machine learning systems. We demonstrate the validity of our approach by retrieving player identities from anonymized event stream data and present a number of use cases related to scouting and monitoring player development in top European competitions.",https://tomdecroos.github.io/reports/ecml19_tomd.pdf
3,Player Chemistry: Striving for a Perfectly Balanced Soccer Team,"Lotte Bransen, Jan Van Haaren",Paper,"SciSports, KU Leuven",28/02/2020,Team Chemistry,,"Soccer scouts typically ignore the team balance and team chemistry when evaluating potential signings for their teams. Instead, they focus on the individual qualities of the players in isolation. To overcome this limitation of their recruitment process, this paper takes a first step towards objectively providing insight into the question: How well does a team of soccer players gel? We address that question in both an observational and a predictive setting. In the former setting, we observe the chemistry between players who have actually played together, which is relevant when selecting the best possible line-up for a match. In the latter setting, we predict the chemistry between players who have never played together before, which is particularly relevant to assess the fit of a potential signing with the players who are already on the team. We introduce two chemistry metrics that measure the offensive and defensive chemistry for a pair of players, respectively.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01712

Although the majority of the on-the-ball actions during games constitutes of passes, many of the currently available metrics focus on measuring the quality of shots only. To help bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach to measure players' on-the-ball contributions from passes during games. Our proposed approach measures the expected impact of each pass on the scoreline.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02252

7,Do Naive xG Models underestimate Expected Goals for Top Teams?,Lars Maurath,Blogpost,Independent,21/12/2020,Expected Goals,,"I have introduced a framework to roughly quantify the varying quality of xG models. By comparing their behavior in analyzing shots from almost 300 team seasons to a hypothetical, true xG model I find that the more sophisticated Statsbomb model outperforms a simpler model. I further investigate if any of the models show a bias in analyzing shots of teams with either high or low shot volume. I find that naive xG models tend to underestimate expected goals for teams with high shot volume and overestimate xG for teams with low shot volume. I do not find this effect for the more sophisticated Statsbomb model that includes additional features like shot freeze frames, goalkeeper positioning and shot impact height.",https://www.thesignificantgame.com/portfolio/do-naive-xg-models-underestimate-expected-goals-for-top-teams/

9,Introducing Expected Threat (xT),Karun Singh,Blogpost,Independent,15/02/2019,Possession & Action Value,,"One simplified way of viewing buildup play is as follows: when a team has possession in a certain position, they can either shoot (and score with some probability), or move the ball to a different location via a pass or a dribble. This continues until the team either loses possession, or scores a goal. If we run with this simplified model of buildup play, what does the data look like? From each position, how often do players shoot (and how often do they score?), how often do they move the ball, and where do they move it to?",https://karun.in/blog/expected-threat.html

11,SoccerMap: A Deep Learning Architecture for Visually-Interpretable Analysis in Soccer,"Javier Fernández, Luke Bornn",Paper,"Polytechnic University of Catalonia, FC Barcelona, Simon Fraser University",20/10/2020,"Possession & Action Value, Tracking Data",,"We present a fully convolutional neural network architecture that is capable of estimating full probability surfaces of potential passes in soccer, derived from high-frequency spatiotemporal data. The network receives layers of low-level inputs and learns a feature hierarchy that produces predictions at different sampling levels, capturing both coarse and fine spatial details. By merging these predictions, we can produce visually-rich probability surfaces for any game situation that allows coaches to develop a fine-grained analysis of players' positioning and decision-making, an as-yet little-explored area in sports. We show the network can perform remarkably well in the estimation of pass success probability, and present how it can be adapted easily to approach two other challenging problems: the estimation of pass-selection likelihood and the prediction of the expected value of a pass. Our approach provides a novel solution for learning a full prediction surface when there is only a single-pixel correspondence between ground-truth outcomes and the predicted probability map. The flexibility of this architecture allows its adaptation to a great variety of practical problems in soccer. We also present a set of practical applications, including the evaluation of passing risk at a player level, the identification of the best potential passing options, and the differentiation of passing tendencies between teams.

12,Valuing On-the-Ball Actions in Soccer: A Critical Comparison of xT and VAEP,"Maaike Van Roy, Pieter Robberechts, Tom Decroos, Jesse Davis",Paper,KU Leuven,28/02/2020,Possession & Action Value,,"Objectively quantifying a soccer player’s contributions within a match is a challenging and crucial task in soccer analytics. Many of the currently available metrics focus on measuring the quality of shots and assists only, although these represent less than 1% of all on-the-ball actions. Most recently, several approaches were proposed to bridge this gap. By valuing how actions increase or decrease the likelihood of yielding a goal, these models are effective tools for quantifying the performances of players for all sorts of actions. However, we lack an understanding of their differences, both conceptually and in practice. Therefore, this paper critically compares two such models: expected threat (xT) and valuing actions by estimating probabilities (VAEP). Both approaches exhibit variety in their design choices, that leads to different top player rankings and major differences in how they value specific actions.",https://tomdecroos.github.io/reports/xt_vs_vaep.pdf

One remaining aspect that we ignored up to now is the effect that the choice of data provider has on xG. It is worth noting that Opta, Statsbomb, Wyscout, Metrica, InStat and all other data providers have their own data quality problems and use different event definitions.

15,Exploring how VAEP values actions,Pieter Robberechts,Blogpost,KU Leuven,27/04/2020,Possession & Action Value,,"Starting from a historical game state, the tool allows you to alter all the attributes that VAEP uses to value an action and to explore how small changes in the game state affect the result. In the short clip below, we show how this works for the goal by Jesus against Wolverhampton in the 2018/19 season. Originally, Jesus’ shot gets a VAEP value of 0.58, but moving Jesus’ further away from the goal increases the VAEP value (because scoring becomes harder further away from the goal). Similarly, the VAEP value decreases a bit if you add one goal to the current scoreline (because scoring the opening goal is considered harder).",https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/sports/blog/exploring-how-vaep-values-actions
16,Introducing Atomic-SPADL: A New Way to Represent Event Stream Data,"Jesse Davis, Tom Decroos, Pieter Robberechts",Blogpost,KU Leuven,05/05/2020,Data,,"To accomodate this alternative viewpoint, we introduce Atomic-SPADL, which removes the “result” attribute from SPADL and adds a few new action and event types. In this representation, all actions are “atomic” in the sense that they are always completed successfully without interruption. Consequently, while SPADL treats a pass as one action consisting of both the initiation and receival of the pass, Atomic-SPADL sees giving and receiving a pass as two separate actions.",https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/sports/blog/introducing-atomic-spadl-a-new-way-to-represent-event-stream-data

Both methods value each game situation in a soccer match by considering how likely it is to score and concede from that particular situation. Both methods exploit the fact that an action alters the game situation and value an action by the difference between the new situation’s value and the previous one’s value. This approach rewards players for increasing their team’s chance of scoring and decreasing their team’s chance of conceding. Therefore, the differences between VAEP and g+ will arise from technical choices made when converting the data into the feature-vector format used to train the gradient boosted ensemble that estimates the scoring and conceding probabilities.",https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/sports/blog/our-thoughts-on-american-soccer-analysis'-g+-metric

In the meantime, we haven’t been standing still and developed SoccerMix: an improved approach which takes account of the location and direction in which actions are performed. Beyond this, we have also introduced a methodology for exploring defensive style. Namely, our insight is that the objective of defending is often to prevent certain actions from occurring.

To this end, we propose a novel framework that combines accurate localization and robust identification of specific keypoints in the image by using a fully-convolutional deep architecture. Our algorithm exploits both the field lines and the players’ image locations, assuming their ground plane positions to be given, to achieve accuracy and robustness that is beyond the current state of the art.

Using this formulation, we propose a method to predict the probability of game outcomes and the payoffs of team actions. Building upon this, we develop algorithms to optimise team formation and in-game tactics with different objectives.

Neural nets achieve great predictive accuracy through deep learning, and are popular in sports analytics. But it is hard to interpret a neural net model and harder still to extract actionable insights from the knowledge implicit in it. Therefore, we built a simple and transparent model that mimics the output of the original deep learning model and represents the learned knowledge in an explicit interpretable way. Our mimic model is a linear model tree, which combines a collection of linear models with a regression-tree structure. The tree version of a neural network achieves high fidelity, explains itself, and produces insights for expert stakeholders such as athletes and coaches. We propose and compare several scalable model tree learning heuristics to address the computational challenge from datasets with millions of data points. ",https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04551

Our neural architecture fits con-tinuous game context signals and sequential features within a play with two stacked LSTMtowers, one for the home team and one for the away team separately. To validate the modelperformance, we illustrate both temporal and spatial projections of the learned Q-function,and conduct a calibration experiment to study the data fit under different game contexts. Ournovel soccer Goal Impact Metric (GIM) applies values from the learned Q-function, to mea-sure a player’s overall performance by the aggregate impact values of his actions over allthe games in a season. To interpret the impact values, a mimic regression tree is built to findthe game features that influence the values most. As an application of our GIM metric, weconduct a case study to rank players in the English Football League (EFL) Championship.Empirical evaluation indicates GIM is a temporally stable metric, and its correlations withstandard measures of soccer success are higher than that computed with other state-of-the-art soccer metrics.",https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343122623_Deep_soccer_analytics_learning_an_action-value_function_for_evaluating_soccer_players
39,Introducing DAVIES: A framework for Identifying Talent Across the Globe,"Mike Imburgio, Sam Goldberg",Blogpost,American Soccer Analysis,17/09/2020,"Scouting, Playing Style, Possession & Action Value",42,"DAVIES, named after MLS phenom and current Bayern Munich outside back Alphonso Davies, was inspired by its namesake’s rise to fame. We wanted to give teams around the globe the same chance as Bayern Munich to identify and sign the next iteration of Alphonso Davies, a player who could be anywhere in the world. So how did we do that? The first step was to build a dataset of players with metrics that are made available by any data provider: xG, xA, Touches, Tackles Won, Passes Attempted, Successful Dribbles, and Clearances are a few examples of the types of metric we included. The next step we took was to build a few different complex models and concatenate them into a singular model. Known as ensemble modeling, this gave the modeling team a better idea of what metrics were actually important to use. After this process was completed, we identified important metrics using data from a different source than our final model used. This allowed us to estimate our model’s accuracy using different data sources and take advantage of the amount of MLS data we had available. Just as importantly, it helped avoid statistical biases that would harm the model’s real-world performance. After this process was completed, we had our final list of 17 important variables that we wanted to include in our final model.",https://www.americansocceranalysis.com/home/2020/9/16/davies-determining-added-value-of-individual-effectiveness-including-style

Lemmin",Paper,University of Groningen,27/10/2020,"Playing Style, Tracking Data",,"Association football teams can be considered complex dynamical systems of individuals grouped in subgroups (defenders, midfielders and attackers), coordinating their behaviour to achieve a shared goal. As research often focusses on collective behaviour, or on static subgroups, the current study aims to analyse spatiotemporal behaviour of dynamic subgroups in relation to successful attacks. We collected position tracking data of 118 Dutch Eredivisie matches, containing 12424 attacks. Attacks were classified as successful (N = 1237) or non-successful (N = 11187) based on the potential of creating a scoring opportunity. Using unsupervised machine learning, we automatically identified dynamic formations based on position tracking data, and identified dynamic subgroups for every timeframe in a match. We then compared the subgroup centroids to assess the intra- and inter-team spatiotemporal synchronisa-tion during successful and non-successful attacks, using circular statistics. Our results indicated sub-group-level variables provided more information, and were more sensitive to disruption, in comparison to team-level variables. When comparing successful and non-successful attacks, we found decreases (p < .01) in longitudinal inter- and intra-team synchrony of interactions involving the defenders of the attacking team during successful attacks.

Orientation data is gathered from body pose estimations that are properly projected onto the 2D game field; moreover, a geometrical solution is provided, through the definition of a feasibility measure, to determine which players are better oriented towards each other. Once analyzed more than 6000 pass events, results show that, by including orientation as a feasibility measure, a robust computational model can be built, reaching more than 0.7 Top-3 accuracy. Finally, the combination of the orientation feasibility measure with the recently introduced Expected Possession Value metric is studied; promising results are obtained, thus showing that existing models can be refined by using orientation as a key feature.

Perhaps more recent examples can further convince you of this occurrence, with Barcelona’s record signings Antoinne Griezzman and Philippe Coutinho performing nowhere near the levels which warranted their purchases so far. As mentioned in Bransen and Van Haaren, despite the importance of player chemistry, this is still a largely overlooked aspect in player evaluation for recruitment purposes, along with existing performance evaluation methods being largely individual-focused (I’m not sure how much this has changed since tbh).

Fastbreak shots off through balls have a high chance of going in because the shooter often has time and space.

Unfortunately, most existing answers have very opaque algorithm training procedures; relevant data are scarcely accessible and almost impossible to generate. In this paper, we will introduce a two-part solution: an open-source Player Tracking model and a new approach to evaluate these players based solely on Deep Reinforcement Learning, without human data training nor guidance. Our tracking model was trained in a supervised fashion on datasets we will also release, and our Evaluation Model relies only on simulations of virtual soccer games. Combining those two architectures allows one to evaluate Soccer Players directly from a live camera without large datasets constraints. We term our new approach Expected Discounted Goal (EDG), as it represents the number of goals a team can score or concede from a particular state. This approach leads to more meaningful results than the existing ones that are based on real-world data, and could easily be extended to other sports. ",https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05388

This paper provides a method for identifying and classifying off-ball in possession runs into similar groups to allow for more generalisable analysis. The objective is to create a vocabulary of run types that can be used to better describe or analyse specific runs and be queried more easily than raw tracking data. These runs are identified by segmenting the raw tracking data using periods of high player speed and acceleration, then classifying them using a clustering method with functional cluster centres modelled as Bézier curves. These run clusters are used to analyse positional trends as well as player archetypes based on common runs. We also discuss a series of potential extensions using these run types as the basis for further analysis based on pre-existing work with tracking data.",https://static.capabiliaserver.com/frontend/clients/barca/wp_prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/40ba07f4-ready-player-run-barcelona.pdf

Using  our  automatic  formation  analysis,we  extend this analysisand show that while teams tend to play the same formation at home as they do away, the manner in which they execute the formation is significantly different. Specifically, we show that the position of the formation of teams at homeis significantly higher up the field compared to when they play away. This conservative approach at away games suggests that coaches aim to win their home games and draw their away games.

In football, measuring the quality of the players’ positioning to receive a pass in condition to score has much value. The Off-Ball Scoring Opportunity model was built to do just that. With that, players receive credit for being well-positioned to score, even if a teammate cannot get them the ball. It was originally modeled to consider the game’s snapshot only when a player executes an action.  However, football is a continuous sport, where decision-making happens at all times, and actions are not discretized as in sports such as baseball and American football. In this paper, we propose a reinterpretation of the original model, where the Off-Ball Scoring Opportunity is calculated for every timestep an attacking player has the ball at his feet. It makes sense, since as long as a player has control of the ball, he can move it somewhere else on the pitch. Through this new form of applying the Off-Ball Scoring Opportunity model, we can build time-series that represent the scoring probability of the next on-ball event at any given moment in time.

Measurement  of  a  team’s  spatial  control  using  player  motion  models fit on average player displacements underestimates a player’s ability to perform high effort displacements during moments of importance (such as winning the ball). We address  this  by  producing  commitment-based  motion  models  that  model  the  effects  of  player momentum on their likelihood to attempt to win the ball (via interceptions). Motion models were fit on approximately 46000 samples of player movement relative to the ball across  264  matches  from  the  2018  MLS  season.  This  approach  to  motion  modelling  incorporates contextual movement behaviour whilst remaining low-dimension, hence is intuitive and interpretable to non-technical staff. Resultant models are used to estimate a player’s spatial influence over their surroundings, given their momentum and proximity to  the  ball.  Player  influence  was  used  to  calculate  the  attacking  team’s  spatial  control  which serves as a proxy for passing risk – that is, a pass is deemed high risk if passed to a region of low control. It was found that attacking players are the senders and receivers of high risk passes due to their positioning in areas of opposition control.

109,Landscapes of passing opportunities in Football – where they are and for how long are available?,"Luis I. Gómez-Jordana, João Milho, Ángel Ric, Rodrigo Silva, Pedro Passos",Paper,"Universidade  de  Lisboa, ",13/11/2019,Possession & Action Value,,"In football, the ball carrier is continuously aiming to perform a pass that outplays as many opponents as possible. The players outplayed are the number of opposing players a ball carrier has in between her/him and her/his own goal. Using this principle landscapes of passing opportunities were created for: i) penetrative passes, ii) support passes, and iii) backward passes.  Using  data  from  a  competitive  match  landscapes  for  each  type  of passing  opportunities  and  half  (1st and  2nd),  were  created  and  displayed  as  heatmaps. Results showed heatmaps with a variety of patterns and with more passing opportunities in the second half of the match. Furthermore, the mean time of passing opportunities were calculated  and  compared  for  each  half  and  for  each  type  of  pass.  Results  display  that penetrative passes were available over shorter periods of time than backward passes that were available shorter than support passes. There were more passing opportunities on the second  half,  which  were  also  available  for  longer  periods.  Moreover,  there  were  more passing opportunities  for penetrative than backwards or support passes. This  landscape model  could  provide  insights  for  football  attacking  dynamics.  It  is  a  customizable  tool that  can  be  implemented  in  real  time  video  analysis  systems,  allowing  collective  and individual players performance analysis.",https://static.capabiliaserver.com/frontend/clients/barca/wp_prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/a41ec6ba-final_paper_barcelona-luis-gomez-jordana.pdf

However, body orientation is a yet-little-explored area in sports analytics. By seeking the 2D orientation of the field  projection  of  the  normal  vector  place din  the  center  of  the  upper-torso  of  players,  this research presents a novel technique to extract orientation automatically from video recordings by merging pose and contextual information. On the one hand, OpenPose is used in combination with a super-resolution network to extract the coordinates of body parts of every single player; by  mapping  pose  parts  (shoulders  and  hips)  in  a  2D  field,  a  first  orientation  estimation is obtained; on the other hand, contextual information quantifies the orientation of each player with respect both to the ball and to the field position. Results have been validated with players-held  EPTS  devices,  obtaining  a  92.4%  accuracy  on  left-right  orientation  directions  and  an absolute  median  error  of  less  than  35  degrees/player.

We model the teams' objectives for a season and track how these evolve as games unfold to give a fluent objective that can aid in decision-making games. We develop Markov chain Monte Carlo and deep learning-based algorithms that make use of the fluent objectives in order to learn from prior games and other games in the environment and increase the teams' long-term performance. Simulations of our approach using real-world datasets from 760 matches shows that by using optimised tactics with our fluent objective and prior games, we can on average increase teams mean expected finishing distribution in the league by up to 35.6%.

113,The Betting Odds Rating System: Using soccer forecasts to forecast soccer,"Fabian Wunderlich, Daniel Memmert",Paper,German Sport University Cologne,26/02/2018,Betting,,"Betting odds are frequently found to outperform mathematical models in sports related forecasting tasks, however the factors contributing to betting odds are not fully traceable and in contrast to rating-based forecasts no straightforward measure of team-specific quality is deducible from the betting odds. The present study investigates the approach of combining the methods of mathematical models and the information included in betting odds. A soccer forecasting model based on the well-known ELO rating system and taking advantage of betting odds as a source of information is presented. Data from almost 15.000 soccer matches (seasons 2007/2008 until 2016/2017) are used, including both domestic matches (English Premier League, German Bundesliga, Spanish Primera Division and Italian Serie A) and international matches (UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europe League). The novel betting odds based ELO model is shown to outperform classic ELO models, thus demonstrating that betting odds prior to a match contain more relevant information than the result of the match itself. It is shown how the novel model can help to gain valuable insights into the quality of soccer teams and its development over time, thus having a practical benefit in performance analysis. Moreover, it is argued that network based approaches might help in further improving rating and forecasting methods.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5988281/pdf/pone.0198668.pdf

121,Leaving Goals on the Pitch - Evaluating Decision Making in Soccer,"Maaike Van Roy, Pieter Robberechts, Wen-Chi Yang, Luc De Raedt, Jesse Davis",Paper,KU Leuven,07/04/2021,Playing Style,,"Analysis of the popular expected goals (xG) metric in soccer has determined that a (slightly) smaller number of high-quality attempts will likely yield more goals than a slew of low-quality ones. This observation has driven a change in shooting behavior. Teams are passing up on shots from outside the penalty box, in the hopes of generating a better shot closer to goal later on. This paper evaluates whether this decrease in long-distance shots is warranted. Therefore, we propose a novel generic framework to reason about decision-making in soccer by combining techniques from machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). First, we model how a team has behaved offensively over the course of two seasons by learning a Markov Decision Process (MDP) from event stream data. Second, we use reasoning techniques arising from the AI literature on verification to each team's MDP. This allows us to reason about the efficacy of certain potential decisions by posing counterfactual questions to the MDP. Our key conclusion is that teams would score more goals if they shot more often from outside the penalty box in a small number of team-specific locations. The proposed framework can easily be extended and applied to analyze other aspects of the game. ",https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03252

To date, studies in football analytics have mainly focused on the attacking side of the game, while there has been less work on event-driven metrics for valuing defensive actions (e.g., tackles and interceptions). Therefore in this paper, we use deep learning techniques to define a novel metric that values such defensive actions by studying the threat of passages of play that preceded them. By doing so, we are able to value defensive actions based on what they prevented from happening in the game. Our Defensive Action Expected Threat (DAxT) model has been validated using real-world event-data from the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 English Premier League seasons, and we combine our model outputs with additional features to derive an overall rating of defensive ability for players.

However, existing orientation estimation methods, which are based on computer-vision techniques, still have a lot of room for improvement. To the best of our knowledge, this article presents the first deep learning model for estimating orientation directly from video footage. By approaching this challenge as a classification problem where classes correspond to orientation bins, and by introducing a cyclic loss function, a well-known convolutional network is refined to provide player orientation data. The model is trained by using ground-truth orientation data obtained from wearable EPTS devices, which are individually compensated with respect to the perceived orientation in the current frame. The obtained results outperform previous methods; in particular, the absolute median error is less than 12 degrees per player. An ablation study is included in order to show the potential generalization to any kind of football video footage. ",https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00359

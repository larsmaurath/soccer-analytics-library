A collection of soccer analytics research

This tool is an attempt to aggregate relevant research on soccer analytics across various topics like Expected Goal models, possession value, tracking date and computer vision.

I hope it will be helpful for building an overview on existing research for a certain topic, finding a paper by author/subject or identifying possible overlaps between research areas.

## Use cases

## Contribute

One person alone cannot possibly know and aggregate all relevant research. If you know a piece that is missing please open an issue above with either the full information or at least the link, and I will add it. Research should be publicly available (not behind a paywall) and introduce a new concept to the community (quality over quantity).
